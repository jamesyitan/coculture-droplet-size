# coculture-droplet-size
Contains directories with MATLAB scripts with necessary data to construct figures for manuscript "The effect of droplet size on syntrophic dynamics in droplet-enabled microbial co-cultivation

The images and MATLAB scripts used to generate the histograms (Figure 1b, 4c) are under the /droplet_histograms directory.

The MATLAB scripts and functions for the ODE model used in Supplementary Note 1 and used to generate Supplementary Figure 2 is under /crossfeeding_simulation directory.

The MATLAB scripts and functions to generate the growth curves (used in Figure 1c,2c,3c, and Supplementary Figure 6) and fit them to the logistic curve and obtain growth parameters (used in Figure 1d,2d,3d, and Supplementary Figure 4) is under /crossfeeding_simulation directory.
